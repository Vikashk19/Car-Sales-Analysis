# Car-Sales-Analysis
This assignment demonstrates the practical application of probability distributions and hypothesis testing to solve real-world industrial problems through a data-driven lens. The work centers on two key analytical components: simulating random events to model uncertainties and performing statistical analysis on a real dataset of used car sales.
